Fork of Shift It.
http://code.google.com/p/shiftit/

All credit goes to the developer of Shift It for providing such an easy code base.

CHANGES
=======
This fork allows multiple monitor window switching and a customised set of keys which doesn't conflict with any of the apps I use (xCode, VLC).

Keys
Control + Alt - Up/Down/Left/Right, for splitting the window in the screen.
Control + Alt + Command - Left/Right, for moving window between screens.

Search for 'ASH:' to find the changes made.

DOWNLOAD
========
The compiled version of ShiftIt.app can be found in the build directory.
